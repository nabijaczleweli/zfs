.TH FSCK.ZFS 8 "Mar 27, 2021" OpenZFS

.SH NAME
fsck.zfs \- Dummy ZFS filesystem checker.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.BI "fsck.zfs [" "options" "] <" "dataset" ">â€¦"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBfsck.zfs\fR is a thin shell wrapper that at most checks the status of a
dataset's container pool. It is installed by OpenZFS because some Linux
distributions expect a fsck helper for all filesystems.
.LP
If more than one \fIdataset\fR is specified, each is checked in turn
and results binary ored.

.SH OPTIONS
.HP
All \fIoptions\fR are ignored.

.SH "NOTES"
.LP
ZFS datasets are checked by running \fBzpool scrub\fR on the
containing pool. An individual ZFS dataset is never checked
independently of its pool, which is unlike a regular filesystem.

.LP
However, the
.BR fsck (8)
interface still allows it to communicate some errors:
if the \fIdataset\fR is in a degraded pool, then \fBfsck.zfs\fR will
return exit code 4 to indicate an uncorrected filesystem error.
.LP
Similarly, if the \fIdataset\fR is in a faulted pool and has a legacy
/etc/fstab record, then \fBfsck.zfs\fR will return exit code 8 to
indicate a fatal operational error.
